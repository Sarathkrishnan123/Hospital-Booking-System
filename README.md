# Hospital-Booking-System

Hospital Booking Management is a web-based application with three main modules: Admin,
Doctor, and Patient. The system aims to streamline the booking process between patients and
doctors, making it efficient for both parties. The admin manages doctor approvals, patient
bookings, and overall system functionality. Doctors can view their appointments and patient
details, while patients can book appointments with doctors from different departments.
